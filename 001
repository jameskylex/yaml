        it is hard for humans to understand computers, but it is even harder for

    You have been using an application and it crashes.

    When you try to re-open the application, it fails to open with a message about
    a file load error.

    Is restarting the computer likely to help?
  shuffleOptions: true
  defaultFeedback: |-
    If you are confused by the answers, have another look at the video on files
  options:
    - answer: yes
      isCorrect: true
      feedback: |-
        That's right. the problem is likely to be that a file was locked by the application and
        stayed locked when it crashed, this is a common problem. An application locks a file to read from it,
        but might crash before unlocking it. You can often fix this problem by
        restarting the computer.

        Another, worse possibility, is that the file has been corrupted by only being
        partially written when it was saved. If it is a resource file, you might need to
        reinstall the application. If it is a document, deleting or moving the file might stop
        the application trying to open it (but obviously won't save the file)
    - answer: no
      isCorrect: false
      feedback: |-
        It won't always work, but the most likely explanation is that the file is still locked,
        and that will be fixed by rest the computer

- typeName: checkbox
  prompt: |-
    Which of the following are likely to happen if two applications write
    to the same file at the same time?
  shuffleOptions: true
  defaultFeedback: |-
    Lot's of things can go wrong if two applications try to access the same file
    at the same time. That is why most operating systems lock files when one
    application is using it so that no other application can access it.

    If you are confused by the answers, have another look at the video on files
  options:
    - answer: The content of the file will become messed up
      isCorrect: true
      feedback: |-
        yes, this is a likely occurance, the file will be a combination of
        the data from the two applications in a random order
    - answer: One of applications will have their data lost
      isCorrect: true
      feedback: |-
        yes, this is actually one of the better outcomes.
        If one application writes its data before the other starts, it's data will be lost
    - answer: The file will be deleted
      isCorrect: false
      feedback: |-
        This is unlikely

    - answer: 1 copy in memory

        The file will remain on the hard disc as well as in memory.
    - answer: 1 copy in on your hard disc
      isCorrect: false
      feedback: |-
        If a file has been loaded, it will also be in memory
    - answer: 2 identical copies, one in memory and one on your hard disc
      isCorrect: false
      feedback: |-
        If changes have not been saved, the copy in memory will be different from the one
        on your hard disc
    - answer: 2 different copies, one in memory and one on your hard disc
      isCorrect: true
      feedback: |-
        Yes, the copy in memory will contain your changes, and the one on the hard disc will
        be the original version

## 1.4.7 Quiz  (autograded, formative): Debugging an Application Problem 

- typeName: checkbox

      # Webpage load errors

      When an application doesn't start properly, or fails to work in other ways
      there are many possible causes, some due to the application
      itself, others due to documents or other files.
      By looking at the symptoms you can often tell what the problem is.

      The following questions will go through some examples.

      Firstly, which of these would happen if the problem was with the document
      you are trying to load?

      Click all that would be true, but before you submit, also think about which would
      be the strongest sign that the problem is with your computer.
  shuffleOptions: true

    If the problem is with a document, your application should work fine with other documents,
    but nothing else is likely to make it work with that document

    If you are unsure about any answers you should review the videos on files, modularity and applications.
  options:

    Application state is a temporary thing that should be fixed with a restart (restarting

    Like application state, operating system state (for example locked files) is temporary, but it will
    only be fixed by restarting the computer. Also, unlike an application state problem, operating system state
    might affect other applications (though a single locked file might not)

        That's right. If two applications try to write to the same file at the same time it could become
        corrupted, because the data from each application will be mixed together. When one application
        opens a file, it becomes locked until the application closes it, so that another application
        cannot open it.
